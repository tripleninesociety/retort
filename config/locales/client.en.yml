          description: |
            Migrate "retorts" created with the Retort plugin to "reactions" created with the <a href="https://meta.discourse.org/t/discourse-reactions-beyond-likes" target="_blank">Discourse Reactions</a> plugin.
            <ul>
            <li>Both plugins need to be installed to run a migration</li>
            <li>If "real run" is unchecked, a report on what will be migrated is produced, but no data is changed.</li>
            <li>Check "delete retort data" to remove retort data after reaction data is created.</li>
            <li>Running a migration multiple times will not produce duplicate Discourse Reactions data.</li>
            </ul>
            
          start: Start Migration
          started: The migration has started. When it's complete, this page will automatically update with the migration report.
